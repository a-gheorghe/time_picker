# time_picker

In this project, I created an implementation of a time-picker using HTML, CSS, and JS. 

The page has three input forms for separate events. Each event has its own event name, location, and time associated with it.
The time can be set by either manually filling in the input field OR by clicking the clock icon beside the time input field.

If the time is filled in manually, the modal that shows up when clicking the associated clock icon will automatically render with the correct time.

When the clock icon is clicked, a modal will show up - by default, it will show the hour view. The hour can be changed by clicking any of the hour buttons.

Clicking on the minutes at the top of the modal will render a minute clock. The minutes can be changed by clicking any of the minutes (or spaces in between the 5 minute intervals as well).

Clicking OK will set the associated input field to the time chosen in the modal. Clicking CANCEL will revert back to the previous time.
